h1. Depricated

This was my first ruby on rails app. 
I have replaced this app with http://github.com/lyle/geekspeak.org 


h1. Edit Podcast is for GeekSpeak

This system is used to edit the "GeekSpeak.org":http://geekspeak.org/ website (show pages, news headlines, and podcast). The publishing side is using Tomcat and Cocoon which shares the same Database as this tool edits. 

The current site, and this system, uses the "mText":http://github.com/ttfkam/mtext/ markup by Miles Elam. 

This system is by no-means a complete podcasting solution. Though I am working on making a rails based public side of this system - and the two may merge to be one rails app. Most-likely this application will be replaced because so much of it was a learning experience for me.
